    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, in British India. He came from a family of freedom fighters and was deeply influenced by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, which he witnessed as a child.

      Singh joined the National College in Lahore in 1923, where he became involved in revolutionary politics and joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) in 1924. He was arrested several times for his activism and spent time in jail, where he read extensively and developed his political ideas.

      In 1928, the British set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of HRA, died of a heart attack during a protest against the commission. Enraged by this incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai’s death and teamed up with other revolutionaries, Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad, to make a plan to kill Scott, the British police officer who had ordered the lathi charge on Rai.

      In 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery. Their intention was not to kill anyone but to gain publicity. After the explosion, the young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they offered themselves for arrest.

      Singh’s growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly, and the government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the Lahore Conspiracy Case. Singh and his comrades were charged with murder and conspiracy to wage war against the British government. They were found guilty and sentenced to death.

      Bhagat Singh was hanged in the Lahore jail on March 23, 1931, at the age of 23. His legacy as a revolutionary socialist and martyr for Indian independence continues to inspire people around the world.
